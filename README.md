My final project for Harvard's cs50: Introduction to Computer Science course.

In cs50, I went from having no background in computer science to creating a simple website where you can write a review for the Six Flags Amusement Parks.

Description:
My final project is a personal blog site for giving reviews about the Six Flags Park. I should mention that I based my format from the finance homework. And I originally wanted to do a normal blog site where anyone can post a review; however, after many attempts I couldn't figure out how to get rid of the log-in required feature without having bugs. This is my very first computer science course and I don't have anyone to assist me. I tried my best with google, the resources found on the course website, and W3. I would have continued trying to make it a normal blog site, but my free trial for IEX Cloud is about to expire. But I have learned a lot from this course and want to continue taking other computer science courses, more specifically data analysis.

As I mentioned earlier, my final project is based on the finance template; therefore, many of these files do the same thing as they did for that previous homework. For example, apology.html is the popups for when you fail to input a username, or for my project, a park name. Change_password.html is when you want to change your password. Layout.html is the layout of the navigation bar and text. Login.html and register.html is for when you login and register.

The new files for my project are "SFlist.html", "write.html", "reviews.html". First, SFlist.html is the homepage that shows you the list of the Six Flags parks. I organized the page by state or country. Under each state/country on a single line, there are two links. The first one is titled the name of the park and it will open the park's homepage on a different tab. The other link's title is the number of each type of rides they have (thrill, kids, and family). I wanted to show the users a small, but crucial detail that could really influence them in going to that specific park. If you click on that link, it will open that park's page of all the rides on a separate tab.

"Write.html" is the file that correlates to the webpage of where to write a review of the park. There are three things needed on this page (reviewer name, park name, and review). I also included a list of the parks, so it would be easier for the reviewer. After writing a review, it would then be posted on the review's webpage, which was created through the "reviews.html". This has all the reviews and shows the three data inputs (reviewer, park name, and review).

When, it came to personal design, I stuck to minimalism. Partially, from lack of skill (at least for now), but also because I preferred it. I originally had all the pages' text to be orientated to the left side of the page, but I preferred it to be in the center. The label on the navigation bar is "Six Flags" and it is red because that is one of the logo's colors of Six Flags. And for the reviews, I placed them in a table because it made the reviews more clear by being able to separate the columns and rows.
